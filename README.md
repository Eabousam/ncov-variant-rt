Analysis of state-by-variant Rt estimates using CDC and GISAID data

Eslam Abousamra, John Huddleston, Marlin Figgins

This project involves a demonstration to build out a framework to perform comparative measurements of the effective reproductive number (Rt) using several methodologies, mostly involving Rstudio epidemiological tool packages which include EpiEstim (Cori A. et al., 2013), EpiNow (Abbott S. et al., 2020), ...

# Tidying Data

## Initial datasets

The SARS-CoV-2 genome data were obtained from the GISAID Initiative, please refer to https://www.gisaid.org for more information. To get access to the metadata dataset, register for a free GISAID account.

The SARS-CoV-2 daily case counts were obtained from the CDC, please refer to https://data.cdc.gov for more information.













## Exploratory Analysis

Here we fit a multinomial logistic regression on SARS-CoV-2 variant frequency growth (estimated from the GISAID metadata) and perfoming initial exploratory analysis and visualizing the competition among the lineages within divisions in the US. 















# Rt Estimation Analysis

## EpiEstim

Here we quantify transmissibility throughout an epidemic from the analysis of time series of incidence as described in Cori et al. (2013) on SARS-CoV-2 data.
